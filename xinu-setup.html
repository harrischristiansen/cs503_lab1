<h1>
XINU Set-up
</h1>
</center>

<h2>
Objectives:
</h2>
The following instructions describe how to:
<ul>
<li>Log onto a XINU Lab workstation, download, extract, and compile a copy of the XINU source.</li>
<li>View the status of existing XINU backends.</li>
<li>Load a built XINU image onto a XINU backend and successfully boot the image.</li>
<li>Modify the XINU source code initialize.c which creates
the first XINU app process that executes function main() which
is located in system/main.c.</li>
</ul>

<hr width="100%">

<b>Please read this whole document and make sure you follow all the instructions. In case you are
stuck, feel free to contact the TA. </b>

<h2>1. XINU Configuration</h2>
To use XINU, several environment variables must be set. First log onto
one of the frontends <b>xinu01.cs.purdue.edu</b>, <b>xinu02.cs.purdue.edu,</b> ..., <b>xinu21.cs.purdue.edu</b> which are Linux 
PCs.
For remote login see Section 5. 
To login you should be able to use your career account user and password.  If you have any trouble with 
your account and its setup, please see the department help pages at <a 
href='http://www.cs.purdue.edu/help'>http://www.cs.purdue.edu/help</a>. If these pages do not address your particular problem, 
please use the trouble command from the command line to report the problem.

<p>The following assumes that your shell 
is bash. The syntax may vary slightly if you use a different shell.
(Run "echo $0" to determine your current shell.)
<p>Setting environment variables for XINU:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; 
Edit <b>.bashrc</b> in your home directory (<b>~/.bashrc</b>) by adding /p/xinu/bin to your path:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>export PATH=${PATH}:/p/xinu/bin</b>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Run&nbsp; <b>source&nbsp; ~/.bashrc</b> (or its equivalent) to
make the change take effect.
<p>Accessing and untarring XINU tarball source files:
<ol>
<li>
Change to your home directory, if you are not already in it.</li>
<br>
<li>Unpack:</li>
<pre>
tar zxvf /u/u3/cs503/xinu-fall17/xinu-fall2017.tar.gz
</pre>
<p>In your home directory, you will now have a directory called xinu-fall2017.
The subdirectories under this directory contain source code, header files,
configuration files, and Makefile for compiling XINU.</p>
</ol>


<hr width="100%">

<h2><b>2. Building XINU</b></h2>
To compile the XINU kernel which will be loaded and executed on a backend
machine, run "make" in the <b>compile/</b> directory:
<pre>
	% cd xinu-fall2017/compile
	% make clean
	% make rebuild
	% make
</pre>
This creates an executable file called <b>xinu</b>.

<br>
<br>

<hr width="100%">

<h2>3. Running XINU</h2>
The executable XINU binary runs on a selected backend machine. 
We have 96 dedicated backends: <b>galileo101.cs.purdue.edu</b>, ..., <b>galileo196.cs.purdue.edu</b>.
<p>The backends are all <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/do-it-yourself/galileo-maker-quark-board.html">Intel Galileo</a>
development boards which run the <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/quark/intel-quark-technologies.html">quark</a>
system on chip processor.<p>
<p>
The backend machines are shared resources. When a backend machine is
grabbed by a student,
it is dedicated for use by that student to run his/her version of XINU.
To see which backends are available for booting XINU, type:
</p>

<pre><b>% cs-status -c quark</b></pre>

This will show you who is using each backend and how
long they have been using it. As with all hardware,
sometimes they fail and may become unavailable until repaired
by our technical staff.
<p>
To boot your copy of XINU on a backend, connect
to a back-end by issuing the command:

<pre><b>% cs-console [galileo1__]</b></pre>
With no arguments cs-console will connect you to the first available backend (including broken ones).

<p>
To load your copy of XINU onto a selected backend:
<pre><b>(control-@) </b>OR <b>(control-spacebar) </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//esc to local command-mode

<b>(command-mode) d</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//download command

<b>file: xinu </b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//tell it to download 'xinu' (this example assumes that you are in the xinu-fall2017/compile directory)

<b>(control-@)</b> OR <b>(control-spacebar)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//esc to local command-mode&nbsp;

<b>(command-mode) p</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//power cycle the backend
</pre>

After several seconds, XINU should boot with a "Welcome to Xinu!" message that looks something like this:
<pre>

<h2>4. Troubleshooting</h2>

<ol>
<li>We only show the mapping from bash to tcsh. If you use other shell types, please contact the TAs. The mapping is as follows:
Edit <b>.cshrc</b> instead of <b>.bashrc</b>. 
Add a line <b>setenv PATH ${PATH}:/p/xinu/bin</b> instead of <b>export PATH=${PATH}:/p/xinu/bin</b>. 
Run <b>tcsh</b> instead of <b>source .bashrc</b>.
<li>Try to figure out what's going on by yourself. Oftentimes the steps
described above were not precisely followed.
<li>When your XINU executable misbehaves or crashes 
(i.e., does not do what you intended
when programming the kernel) then debug the problem(s) and try again.
Since your version of the XINU kernel runs over dedicated hardware,
you are in full control. 
That is, there are no hidden side effects introduced by other
software layers that you are not privy to.  
By the same token, everything rests on your shoulders.
<li>If you get repeatedly stuck with "Booting XINU on ... " 
please contact the TAs.
<li>If you are not able to get a free backend, please contact the
TAs.
</ol>

<hr width="100%">

<h2>5. Remote Login</h2>
<p>
Use of the backends is limited to implementing, testing, and
evaluating lab assignments of CS 503. To access the backends, you don't
have to be physically present in the XINU lab but may remote login
using ssh to one of the lab's frontend machines. 
</p>

<hr width="100%">

<h2>6. An Example App: XINU Shell</h2>
<p>
By default, when XINU boots up, it runs a shell (xsh).  To view all the
usable shell commands, run the help command:
</p>
<pre>
	xsh $ help

	shell commands are:

	argecho      date         help         netinfo      udp          ?
	arp          devdump      kill         ping         udpecho
	cat          echo         memdump      ps           udpeserver
	clear        exit         memstat      sleep        uptime
</pre>
<p>
Take a moment to run some shell commands and view their output.  
Specifically make sure you run the ps command which lists 
information about running processes.
</p>
<pre>
	xsh $ ps
	Pid Name             State Prio Ppid Stack Base Stack Ptr  Stack Size
	--- ---------------- ----- ---- ---- ---------- ---------- ----------
	  0 prnull           ready    0    0 0x0EFDEFFC 0x0EFDEEB0     8192
	  1 rdsproc          susp   200    0 0x0EFDCFFC 0x0EFDCFC8    16384
	  2 ipout            wait   500    0 0x0EFD8FFC 0x0EFD8F40     8192
	  3 netin            wait   500    0 0x0EFD6FFC 0x0EFD6EE0     8192
	  5 Main process     recv    20    4 0x0EFC4FFC 0x0EFC4F64    65536
	  6 shell            recv    50    5 0x0EFB4FFC 0x0EFB4C7C     8192
	  8 ps               curr    20    6 0x0EFD4FFC 0x0EFD4DC8     8192
</pre>
<p>
Here you can see the several pieces of information for all processes 
currently running.  The name gives some detail about what the process 
is intended for.  XINU always contains a special process with process 
identifier (pid) 0 called the null process (or prnull).  This process 
is the first process created by XINU and is always ready to execute.  
Unlike other processes, prnull is handcrafted without using create().
The inclusion of this process ensures that there is always something 
for XINU to execute even if all other processes have finished or are 
waiting for something. By default, UNIX/Linux and Windows have similar
null or idle processes.
</p>

<h2>7. Running Other Apps</h2>

<p>
Instead of creating a shell process, in the labs you will create
app processes which will test/benchmark your XINU kernel modifications.
For example, the "Hello World!" message may be generated by a new
process running function myprocess()
</p>
<pre>
	void myprocess(void) {
		kprintf("Hello world again!\n");
	}
</pre>
instead of code inserted into main().
<p>
Just remove the code in main.c that creates a shell process and replace it 
with the following:
<p>
<pre>
	resume(create(myprocess, 4096, 25, "helloworld", 0));
	while(TRUE) {
		// Do nothing
	}
</pre>
<p>
Compile a new XINU image, download it to your XINU backend, and power 
cycle the backend.
Once XINU boots up, you should see the message "Hello world again!" printed 
to the console. How many processes you will create from within main()
and what code they will execute will depend on the specifics of each lab.
</p>

<p>
  If you insist on adding new functions in a new file rather than in main.c or
  other existing files, simply do <pre>make rebuild</pre> before any follow-up
  make.
</p>
<p>
  That being said, in this and following labs, we may have already created files
  for you to fill code in. In that way it may help simplify the testing/grading
  process.
